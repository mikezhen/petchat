We use the `react-testing-library` to test our UI components at the DOM level to avoid focus on [implementation details](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/testing-implementation-details).\
Check out [this blog](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-know-what-to-test) to help figure out what to test!

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
